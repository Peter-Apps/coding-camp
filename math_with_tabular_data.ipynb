        "This notebook was designed by [Quarknet](https://quarknet.org/) Teaching and Learning Fellow [Adam LaMee](https://adamlamee.github.io/). The handy csv files were created from the CMS Run2011A primary datasets and converted from ROOT format by the masterful [Tom McCauley](https://github.com/tpmccauley). More can be found on the [CERN OpenData](http://opendata.cern.ch/?ln=en) site, like [here](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/545). The 3D vector image can be found on [WikiMedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coord_XYZ.svg). Finally, thanks to the great folks at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for making this notebook interactive without you needing to download it or install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your own device.
